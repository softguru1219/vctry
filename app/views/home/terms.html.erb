VCTRY allows registered customers (hereafter called “Users”) to create user accounts (hereafter called “Accounts”) and organizes the matches. VCTRY connects the platform and the publishers of the respective games (hereafter called “Games-Publisher”). Via VCTRY users are able to compete against each other in tournaments, challenges, and leagues and can win prizes and/or real money.
      </div>
      <div class="mt-3">
        <span class="pr-2">1.2</span> The respective games offered on VCTRY are not being run by VCTRY rather than the Games-Publishers. The Platform-Provider cannot influence the outcome of the matches nor the Games-Publisher’s terms and conditions. VCTRY solely connects the games with its users. Therefore the Platform-Provider cannot be held responsible for the game’s availability.

Should one of the offered games become a game of chance in the meantime, the Platform-Provider reserves the right to remove the game from its offered games list.
